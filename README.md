TX6U-Monitor
============

Simple Arduino code + library (coming soon) that capture temperature from the LaCrosse TX6U Wireless Sensor.

WARN: This is an alpha release of my work, only tested on ARDUINO DUE if you want to try it on other board just change the interrupt define on line 61 but attention, check (in according with your beard model) if you need to change also line 284. 

Example
currState = digitalRead(<pin number>); //for example if you use Arduino UNO you have to change it with 2 if you use interrupt 0
